# Simon Hampton

![Simon Hampton](images/simonhampton.jpg)After beginning as a programmer in the 1980s, most of my [career](https://be.linkedin.com/in/simonhampton) has been in other other areas. I recently retrained at Leuven University, Coursera, Udacity in programming and machine learning, and now deliver modern, functional approaches to software challenges.

I am **available for freelance work**, and have experience in a variety of modern languages & frameworks, including MEAN-stack (Mongo, Express, Angularjs, Node), Wordpress, Bootstrap, Haskell and Elm. Please see my [homepage](http://simonh1000.github.io/) for some examples of my work, and a summary of the technologies used.

I have a number of open-source libraries for Node and Elm; over 4000 Stackoverflow points; and am also the organiser of Belgium's Haskell Users Group. I occasionally [blog](http://simonh1000.github.io/) as well.
