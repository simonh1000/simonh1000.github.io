The accompanying instructions for building the PiBot (formally Tiddlybot) were simple enough to follow, but the software feels more randomly scattered across sites and repositories.

# Connecting to wifi
Needed a software update from http://www.pibot.org/tiddlybot/images/ (v1.1 worked much better than the version shipped with the pibot)

The basic configuration is for the Tiddlybot to provide its own wifi network to which you connect your computer. As a result, however, you lose access to the Internet itself. An alternative is to connect the tiddlybot to your local network, and then connect to the tiddlybot over that network (using ssh).

To do that you need to attach a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi and reconfigure it to work with other wifi networks. http://pibot.org/how-to/basics#tab3
